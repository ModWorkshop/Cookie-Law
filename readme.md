Fork: this fork is a modified version of the cookie law plugin to update it to work properly in our server + some changes that are exclusively relevent to our site.
To make sure mybb doesn't set cookies when cookies are disabled, 2 files need small changes:
inc/functions.php: 
```php
function my_setcookie($name, $value="", $expires="", $httponly=false, $samesite="", $bypass_cookieopt=false)
  global $mybb;

  //Avoid setting cookies when cookies are not allowed.
	if(!$bypass_cookieopt && isset($mybb->cookies['allow_cookies']) && $mybb->cookies['allow_cookies'] == '0')
		return;
```
jscripts/general.js (head of the Cookie.set function), : 
```js
		if(Cookie.get('allow_cookies') !== '1')
			return
```


This plugin is unlikely to receive any further updates.
